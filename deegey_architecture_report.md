## Key Technical Decisions

### Frontend Strategy
- **React Web App**: Handles admin dashboard, desktop user experience, SEO-optimized content, and customer support tools
- **Flutter Mobile App**: Primary user interface with existing 70% complete codebase preserved and integrated with new backend
- **Shared API Layer**: Single Express.js server provides consistent data access for both frontend applications

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js API Server**: Custom business logic layer enabling matrimonial-specific features not possible with WordPress
- **Supabase Backend**: Modern PostgreSQL database with built-in real-time capabilities, authentication, and file storage
- **Socket.io Integration**: Real-time messaging and live updates for enhanced user engagement

### Data Flow
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens managed by Express.js with Supabase Auth integration
- **Profile Data**: Complex matrimonial queries handled by PostgreSQL with optimized indexing
- **Real-time Features**: Socket.io connections for messaging and live match notifications
- **File Management**: Profile photos stored in Supabase Storage with automatic CDN optimization

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Migration Complexity**: Mitigated by maintaining existing Flutter app structure and gradual API migration
- **Real-time Performance**: Addressed through Supabase's proven WebSocket infrastructure and Express.js optimization
- **Scalability Concerns**: Resolved with cloud-native Supabase backend and horizontal scaling capabilities

### Business Risks
- **Development Timeline**: 8-week timeline is conservative with clear milestones and deliverables
- **User Migration**: Smooth transition maintained by preserving mobile app user experience
- **Feature Parity**: New architecture enables features impossible with WordPress, providing competitive advantage

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical Performance
- API response times under 200ms for profile queries
- Real-time message delivery under 100ms
- Mobile app crash rate below 1%
- 99.9% uptime for core matrimonial features

### Business Outcomes
- Reduced development time for new features by 60%
- Increased user engagement through real-time features
- Improved user acquisition through better mobile experience
- Enhanced scalability to support 10,000+ concurrent users

**Conclusion**: This architecture positions DeeGey as a modern, scalable matrimonial platform capable of competing with established players while serving the unique needs of the Sri Lankan diaspora community.
